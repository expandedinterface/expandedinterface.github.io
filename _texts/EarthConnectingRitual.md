*Modern and pre-modern artists and Scientists The city and the wilderness Eastern and western My hand on my phone in my pocket Connecting To everyone I know Whenever I want. The microbes on the screen Their feelings Electromagnetic radiation rapidly exchanged Fingertips Fingertips Fingertips The wall Culture Nature Microcosm of a larger process Technology as culture, surrounding us What is the appropriate adaptation in this situation? If the world always already speaks, even without us trying Even before we make the dance, the song, the painting the program How do we adapt alongside.*

- Earth Connecting Ritual
 
- Start standing with your feet wider apart than your shoulders.
- Start shaking by pressing more and more weight into the floor through your feet. 
- Relax your arms and shoulders.
- Continue shaking for a long period of time (at least 15 minutes).
- Tap into the world’s vibrations.
- Let your body and limbs move with the vibrations.
- Stomping here is also an option but the shaking must continue.
- When you’re done, begin to stop slowly.
- Be careful to do this slowly and gently.
- Close your eyes.
- Feel the leftover vibration in your body as interface.
- Repeat as needed.

(This ritual is best experienced by doing it consistently and completely after each time you've spent a prolonged period of time working on a tech interfaces and /or in any kind of earth connecting emergency).
