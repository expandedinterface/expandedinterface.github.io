_Interfaces are becoming increasingly invisible. User friendly now meaning non detected or hidden you won’t even know it’s there technology. ( REFERENCE) But in fact, interfaces are more helpful when the user is able to point at them. An invisible interface does not allow the user to be aware of the views and opinions that owners and creators develop into the interfaces inherently. It is precisely this invisibility that is the problem to be addressed. Ubiquitous computing (REFERENCE) becoming more and more prevalent, how do we want to interface with all of this. Can we restore transparency as visibility?_

_Inke Arns in “Transparent World: Minoritarian tactics in the age of transparency” talks of the “software-assisted disappearance of the world". She describes "transparent interfaces” as “one(s) that the user can neither detect nor notice.” Ease of use as an objective in design and engineering can be linked to Heidegger’s philosophies around tool use, namely aiming to make tools or interfaces that are “ready-to-hand." Creating tools that feel like second nature to use is by no means something that should be entirely abandoned. However, as ubiquitous computing becomes more prevalent--its embedded nature perhaps magnifying this already strong drive--we ask, do we really want to forget that we are using an interface? Can we, as Arns posits, restore “to the IT-based notion of transparency the original meaning of clearness and controllability through visibility?”_
