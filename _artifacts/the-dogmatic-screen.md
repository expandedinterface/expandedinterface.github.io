_In a world where belief literally changes reality, how would machines develop? What would human-machine interaction look like?
Premise: reality is still bound by the laws of physics as we know them today. No transmutations, no anti-entropic behaviour, no magic._

It won’t turn on.

Mom and Dad do it all the time. They just reach out, a blissful smile spreads across their face, they say the Thought of The Day, and the boring gray box lights up in all different colors.
Well, no one’s home and I decided to give it a try. I did everything I was supposed to! I did exactly what they do. But nothing happens. I don’t understand why it won’t listen to me. And I don’t understand why I need to say the stupid Thought. It makes no sense.

> We are what we have been made, we follow truth, and truth comes only from one place.

There, I said it again.

TURN.

ON.
