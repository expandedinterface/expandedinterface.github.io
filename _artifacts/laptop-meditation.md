You have been typing for too long.   

Put your hands on your lap.   
Let the light fade from your screen.   

Shut the lid.       

Pick up your laptop, turn it in your hands,     
Hold the warm underside to your cheek.    

Close your eyes.     
Can you hear the fan whirring? What is its smell?    

Put your laptop down and stand up.    
Can you feel the trackpad in your shoulder?   

Walk to the window or a door. Reach outside.    
Feel the wall. Is it damp? Is it warm?    

Return to your desk or bed or sofa.      

How do you feel?
