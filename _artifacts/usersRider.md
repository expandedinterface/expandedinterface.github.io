                                 USER’S RIDER

____________________________________________________________________________

     I, THE USER, REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY INTERACTION, PROFESSIONAL 
     OR OTHERWISE, UNTIL THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET TO A 
     SATISFACTORY STANDARD:

1. If you’re going to collect my data, at least ask me first and say thank you. I’m making you a fortune, the least you could do is be polite. And I don’t mean giving me a link to your privacy policy, just make it clear when you’re tracking me that you’re storing that information so I don’t feel like I’m being stalked every time you ‘recommend’ something to me.

2. No gaslighting my conversations with my friends, I don’t need a “...” or a “seen” at inappropriate times. I’d rather not have a functionality which makes me feel like shit in the wrong scenario.

3. I know you love watching videos late at night with me, but if I’ve got an early start the next day constantly suggesting more things for me to watch is a bit rude.

4. Seamlessly doing everything for me is great but I’m also interested in how this stuff works! Tell me a little bit about yourself sometimes. It feels like you’re my slave up until the second you can’t do something and then I can’t help because I don’t know anything about how you work.

5. If I’m really upset and stressed, don’t shuffle songs onto AC/DC please. That said, I know how much you love collecting data and if you’re going to be able to pick up information about my mood don’t store that! There’s such a thing as tact.

6. I work with you pretty intensively and I need a more varied work environment than sitting being plugged into a wall. I would like to work on some more physical stuff with you, maybe standing or walking around. Its pretty easy to get RSI and bad posture with the pose you keep demanding I work in.
